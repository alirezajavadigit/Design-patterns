# Design Patterns

In this project, I provide examples of all major design patterns and demonstrate how they are implemented in PHP.

## About

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in PHP, following best practices and including clear examples to help developers understand and apply these patterns in their projects.

## Implemented Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. See the [Singleton example](src/Creational/Singleton/Singleton.php) for an implementation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alirezajavadigit/Design-patterns.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired pattern's directory (e.g., `src/Creational/Singleton`).
3. Run the PHP file to see the example in action:
   ```bash
   php src/Creational/Singleton/Singleton.php
   ```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To add a new design pattern:
1. Create a new directory under `src/` corresponding to the pattern category (e.g., `Creational`, `Structural`, `Behavioral`).
2. Add your PHP implementation with clear comments and example usage.
3. Update this README to include the new pattern.
4. Submit a pull request.
